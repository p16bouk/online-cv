    summary: |
      My name is Charalampos Bouklis and I am 21 years old. I'm student in Ionian University. 
      I think that if you have tenacity for solving your life-hardships and your own troubles you can
      also make your dream come true. My personal dream is to be scientist of computers and 
      informatics, make my family, be a happy and fair person and I'm working on this. I really enjoy 
      working on teams and I every time try to give my best for my team and my colleagues.

        In 2016, my goal was to pass the school's exams to get in this department. And now, I enjoy the lessons,
        the professors and the labs that my University provides to us. I would like to successfully finish the 
        assignments of all the lessons and make my thesis. 
        So, sectors that I want to be occupied with are:
