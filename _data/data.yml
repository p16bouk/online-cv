    title: Introducing myself
    summary: |
      My name is Charalampos Bouklis and I am 21 years old. I'm student in Ionian University. 
      I think that if you have tenacity for solving your life-hardships and your own troubles you can
      also make your dream come true. My personal dream is to be scientist of computers and 
      informatics, make my family, be a happy and fair person and I'm working on this. I really enjoy 
      working on teams and I every time try to give my best for my team and my colleagues. 

education:
    - degree: BSc in Department of Informatics
      university: Ionian University
      time: 2016 - Today
      details: |
        In 2016, my goal was to pass the school's exams to get in this department. And now, I enjoy the lessons,
        the professors and the labs that my University provides to us. I would like to successfully finish the 
        assignments of all the lessons and make my thesis. 
        So, sectors that I want to be occupied with are:

          - Data Bases
          - Programming in Java
          - Graphics
          - Information Retrieval

    
experiences:
    - role: Cashier
      time: 2018
      company: McDonald's
      details: |
        I was working for ten (10) months for McDonald's Greece as a cashier. My job was 
        to service the customers, cleaning, filling soft drinks, frying and setting up the
        customer's tray. I decided to work because I wanted to help my mum and dad with our expenditures.

          

    - role: Waiter
      time: 2018-2019
      company: El Greco Pizza
      details: |
        At this point of my life, I was working as a waiter in a pizzeria to have my own pocket money.
